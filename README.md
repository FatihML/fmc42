### A Comparative Analysis of Generative Adversarial Networks for Single Image Super-Resolution
In recent years, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been significantly popular, achieving state-of-the-art performance in generating images with high human perceptual quality and proposing various novel approaches for solving the Single Image Super
Resolution (SISR) problem. Although the rise of techniques like transformers and diffusion
models has shifted the interest away from GANs, they are not yet superseded and remain
highly competitive when optimally trained. However, there is a lack of studies proving that,
while providing a comparative analysis of the aforementioned methods in the light of recent
developments in SISR. Such a comparison would be useful for understanding the strengths
and weaknesses of different GAN-based algorithms and providing insights into the key factors that affect the model performance for SISR, including the architecture of the generator
and discriminator, the use of various perceptual and adversarial loss functions, and training
strategies. This analysis will be valuable for anyone developing new GAN-based models,
offering guidance on whether GAN-based approaches are likely to yield significant performance improvements, and leading to the development of more robust and efficient SISR
solutions in resource-limited environments.
